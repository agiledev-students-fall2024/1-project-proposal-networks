### Project title

NetWorks: Volleyball Connections for College Recruitment

### What and why?

The goal of this app is to provide high school athletes with guidance to help navigate the difficult process of recuiting for a collegiate sport. The app would faciliate a mentorship program that would connect a collegiate volleyball athelete with a high school volleyball player looking to play in college. 

Both the mentee and the mentor will be asked to fill out a questionnaire to figure both of their preferences. Once all the data is collected, the mentors and mentees will be paired using an algorithm. The app will allow the mentors and mentees to schedule their meetings. For each meeting, the app will have a page of suggested talking points to help facilitate conversation about the recruiting process. For the first phase of the app, the mentorship program will last 2 months, with the pairs meeting at least 6 times. If the app has positive feedback, other sports such as basketball or baseball/softball can also be included in future iterations.

### For whom?

In 2023, there were around 500,000 high school students playing volleyball. The sport continues to grow and continues to get more competitive each year. Many high school students struggle to navigate the complexities of trying to get recruited by a college. There are many factors that a high school student must consider when trying to get recruited such as what division to play for, what type of school, and what athletics program is a good fit. 

I was on the NYU's Women's volleyball team and have gone through the recruiting process myself. After speaking with many of my friends who are collegiate athletes, I know this app would have been so beneficial for us. I also know many athletes and high school players who would love to use the app right away. 


### How?

From an end-user's perspective, NetWorks will have the following features:

#### 1. User Registration and Profile Management:
Mentees and Mentors will sign up and create a profile with their relevant details (name, high school, age, etc.). They will then be asked to fill out a questionnaire to describe their preferences regarding recruiting and colleges. Their answers will then populate to their profile. 

#### 2. Meeting Dashboard:
The meeting dashboard will allow mentors to schedule meeting times with mentees. Once a meeting has been scheduled, the meeting information will appear on both the mentors and meentees meeting dashboard with relevant meeting details such as meeting time and meeting platform (ie. Zoom, Google Meet, phone number).

#### 3. Notifications: 
The app will send push notifications to alert mentors and mentees of an upcoming meeting. 


### Scope

The project is neither too easy nor too ambitious for a group of approximately 4 - 6 programmers to undertake in one semester. The project requires full stack development (creating a backend that deals with data storage, notification, and data collection as well as a user-friendly frontend), algorithm development (developing an algorithm to pair the mentors and the mentees together based on the informaiton submitted from the questionnaire) and API usage. This project is manageable and can be completed in one semester.
